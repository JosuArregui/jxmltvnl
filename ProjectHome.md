The goal is to make xmltv grabber in java for tvgids.nl

**Updated xslt for the new guide layout available in the download section!**
These also work in older versions so you don't _have_ to update to 1.2.6.

The grabber has modular structure. Following opensource technologies has been used:

commons-logging
commons-httpclient
springframework
xmlbeans
