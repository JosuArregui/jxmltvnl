Installation tips

= Details =

1. Download zip
2. Unzip it ;)
3. in cofig/log4j.xml set your log level (info for org.anuta will do)
4. in tvgids.xml change location of the cache and output file. Proxy can be added there too
5. run start.sh

After all is done, use mythfilldatabase --file to import it
